    'We got the idea for TesselloScore from mobile phone-based finance service M-Pesa based in Kenya and Tanzania. Besides operating similarly to Venmo, M-Pesa allows its users to take out loans, calculating their trustworthiness according to their own set of metrics. Some of these metrics include SMS, phone call, and transaction history. This inspired us to look to unconventional methods of calculating our version of a credit score so we could take into consideration metrics that would create a fuller picture of our users. In this way, TesselloScore is more transparent and accurate than other credit scores out there.',
    'We reinvented the credit score from first principles, defining it as a measure of creditworthiness, then brainstorming indicators of creditworthiness from both intuition, and academic journals on economic behavior.',
    'These indicators are then measured as objectively as possible, and tagged to an individual, along with his historical creditworthiness. By aggregating this data over tens of thousands of users, a Machine Learning algorithm then identifies correlations between indicators and creditworthiness and outputs weightings that are used to make predictions on future users.',

    'The biggest headaches when going to games are traffic, parking, and looking people to go with. By rewarding drivers with parking and arena promotions, FanScoop enables the Kings app to solve all of these problems. It encourages users to connect and stay in touch, building communities of fans who will continue going to games together.',
    'Sports is about community. Watching a game alone at home is a completely different experience from watching at a place full of fans. Users are not just any strangers. They are people who share a common passion for basketball and are about to watch the same game. Users will hype each other up, build community, and enhance each otherâ€™s experience.',
